# Phonon_EMP_Diag  
The tool can quickly obtain all enforced band crossing information via compatibility relations along all high-symmetry lines, including their corresponding irreducible representations, topological properties, associated emergent particles, and the number of times each enforced band crossing appears for all 10,034 materials stored in [*the public phonon database at Kyoto University*](https://github.com/atztogo/phonondb).  


**Quick Start**:  


```python
    python generate_table.py  
```

An interactive menu will appear:  

1. **EMP Catalog**: Show 10 types of emergent particles formed by two different irreducible representations that can appear along high-symmetry lines in the phonon system.  
2. **Material Catalog**: Enter a space group number to list all materials and the names and coordinates of all high-symmetry lines.  
3. **Diagnosis Result**: Enter space group and Material Project Identification number to print the diagnosis results for high-symmetry lines.
